# @contentful/live-preview

Preview SDK for both the field tagging connection + live content updates by [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

It uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and is bundled using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#library-mode).

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js: `>=16.15.1`
- Yarn: `>=1.21.1`

To install live preview simply run one of the following commands.

```
yarn add @contentful/live-preview
```

or

```
npm install @contentful/live-preview
```

## Documentation

### Initializing the SDK

To establish a communication between your preview frontend and Contentful, you simply need to initialize the live preview SDK. This can be done by executing the following command:

```
import { ContentfulLivePreview } from '@contentful/live-preview';

...

ContentfulLivePreview.init();
```

### Field Tagging

To tag fields you need to add the live preview data-attributes to the rendered HTML element output.
You can do this in React via our helper function.
The necessary styles for the live edit tags can be found in the '@contentful/live-preview/dist/style.css' file.

```
import { ContentfulLivePreview } from '@contentful/live-preview';
import '@contentful/live-preview/dist/style.css';
...

<h1 {...ContentfulLivePreview.getProps({ entryId: id, fieldId: 'title', locale })}>
  {title}
</h1>
```

### Live Updates

Live Updates from the editor to your applications are currently only supported for [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

```tsx
import { useContentfulLiveUpdates } from "@contentful/live-preview/dist/react"

// ...
const updated = useContentfulLiveUpdates(originalData, locale)
// ...
```
