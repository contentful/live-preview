# Example Projects Overview

This README provides a comprehensive overview of our various example projects to assist you in selecting the most appropriate example based on your specific requirements.

## next-app-router (recommended)

Client-Side Hydration: This setup integrates client components, facilitating the client-side hydration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This feature enables the use of hooks for instant live updates directly in the browser.
Real-Time Live Updates: Features a live update system that allows fields to dynamically update as edits are made, providing immediate feedback without requiring a save action.

## next-14-app-router-ssr

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Focus: This example exclusively utilizes server-side rendering, with minimal client-side interactions limited to loading the Live Preview SDK in a standalone script.
Conditional Revalidation: Configured to trigger a revalidation process through a designated endpoint whenever changes are saved in Contentful, refreshing the page to display new content after a brief delay of 5 seconds.

## next-13-app-router-ssr

Enhanced SSR with Client-Side Reloading: Operates similarly to the next-14-app-router-ssr but includes a script that forcefully reloads the iframe if an entryâ€™s save event is detected in Contentful, effective after 5-seconds. This script supports both Next 13 and Next 14 versions.

## next-pages-router

Integration with Pages Router: Demonstrates how to utilize the `@contentful/live-preview` SDK within a Next.js Pages Router setup.

## Remix

Remix Framework Compatibility: Provides an example of how to integrate the `@contentful/live-preview` SDK with a Remix application.

## Vanilla JS

Offers a basic demonstration of employing the `@contentful/live-preview` SDK within a straightforward Vanilla JavaScript environment.

## Gatsby

Limited Gatsby Support: Currently, while Inspector Mode is operational in Gatsby, there is an issue with live updates. Due to Gatsby's unique processing of data from the Content Preview API into its GraphQL schema, live updates via the Live Preview SDK are not supported.
